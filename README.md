## üöÄ Project Overview

This is my personal portfolio. It showcases my background as a Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary, along with a selection of projects and interests. The site is tuned for production performance, accessibility, and clean UX.

<a name="highlights"></a>
## ‚ú® Highlights

- 100/100 Lighthouse on all pages in production (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Modern UI/UX with smooth, GPU-friendly animations
- Fully responsive (mobile ‚Üí desktop) with zero layout shift (CLS)
- Per-page SEO, structured data, and careful head/CSP configuration

<a name="features"></a>
## üîé Features

- Per-page SEO via `src/components/SEO.js` (Open Graph, Twitter, canonical)
- Structured data (JSON-LD) in `pages/_document.js`
- Strict security headers and CSP in `next.config.mjs`
- Optimized images via `next/image` + a thin wrapper (`OptimizedImage`)
- Motion enhancements with framer-motion (compositor-friendly)
- Responsive layouts with Tailwind; mobile-first
- Web Vitals collection (silent) via `WebVitals`
- Idle-time route prefetching (`usePrefetch`) for instant navigation
- Floating "Contact" launcher with chat-like quick-copy actions
- Projects page with modal image/video preview
- Resume page with embedded PDF and download

<a name="performance-and-accessibility"></a>
## ‚ö° Performance and Accessibility

- 100/100 across all Lighthouse categories in production
- LCP images use `priority` and avoid fade-in to prevent LCP delays
- Animations rely on transform/opacity for GPU compositing
- `sizes` and `fill` are used to prevent layout thrash and ensure proper responsive images
- Secondary UI (e.g., Contact) is code-split/dynamically imported to reduce initial JS
- Accessibility: semantic structure, contrast, keyboard-friendly, live regions for feedback

### Lighthouse (production)

The following score was captured from the production server.

![Lighthouse score (production)](docs/Lighthouse-score.png)

<a name="development-vs-production"></a>
## üß™ Development vs Production

- Dev adds HMR, react-refresh, websockets ‚Üí expect lower Lighthouse in dev
- Prod removes dev overlays, minifies, and tree-shakes ‚Üí target scores achieved
- Measure Lighthouse on: `npm run build && npm start`

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## üõ† Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node 18+ recommended

```bash
cd zain-portfolio-next
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

<a name="environment-variables"></a>
## üîê Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` (not committed) for local development if needed.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (recommended)
  - e.g., `https://muhammadzain.vercel.app` (or your custom domain)

<a name="deployment"></a>
## üö¢ Deployment

This site is deployed on Vercel.

<a name="development-journey"></a>
## üõ§ Development Journey

This project reflects several iterations of UI polish, performance tuning, and accessibility improvements. It was built with a strong emphasis on clean code, minimal layout shift, and excellent SEO.

**AI-Assisted Development** (Cursor AI / GPT-5) helped with:
- Performance tuning (Lighthouse targets, LCP/TBT tweaks)
- Accessibility and SEO auditing
- Code health improvements (CSP, header hygiene, prefetch correctness)
- Non-intrusive analytics hooks (web-vitals)

All changes were reviewed to ensure the final result matches my design and quality standards.

<a name="testing-and-quality"></a>
## ‚úÖ Testing and Quality

- Manual testing across desktop and mobile viewports
- Lighthouse audits (desktop + mobile) in production
- Code review and refactoring passes for clarity and maintainability
